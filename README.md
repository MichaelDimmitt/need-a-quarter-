# need-a-quarter-
need a quarter? rate limit machine

## Situation
when at a landramat quarters are really valuable.

someone lost a quarter or the machine ate a quarter

now I have 1.25 but the cost is 1.50

## Problem
Give out quarters but do not give away all of the quarters.

## Solve
Dispense a rate limiter inside of a strong box

20 minute cooldown per quarter dispensed.

At worst case this would put out 
18 dollars per day - 72 quarters per day - 3 quarter per hour x 24 hours
9 dollars per day - 36 quarters per half day - 3 quarter per hour x 12 hours

people can sponsor the box.
to put their marketing campaign on the box.

or people could crowd fund by adding quarters in real time.
no rate limit going in but rate limit going out.

## Additional benefit
As a worst case if someone tries to game the system they could grab their own quarters and re-sell them to others at a premium.
